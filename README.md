# Restaurant-Management_Billing

ðŸš€ Just completed a Hotel Management System project using Python!

As someone starting out in Data Science, Iâ€™m actively building small projects to strengthen my programming foundation. This particular project gave me hands-on experience with Object-Oriented Programming in Python â€” using class and def to simulate real-life hotel operations like:

âœ… Owner's View

âœ… Food ordering with live stock updates

âœ… Auto GST billing (5%)

âœ… Multiple payment modes

It was exciting to see how structured logic and modular code could bring a real-world system to life. Every part of this helped deepen my understanding of OOP, and Iâ€™m one step more confident on my learning journey.

ðŸ”§ Built with pure Python â€“ no external libraries â€“ just clean logic and curiosity.
